The tools directory offers scripts to create featuretype definitions (GML application schemata) which
enable the access of WFS to the data source (databases or files). Im most cases you have to edit these
scripts to adapt them to your local system. To do so, just use a text editor. Furthermore there are 
tools to create an index on shapefiles or to print out the supported SRS by deegree.
